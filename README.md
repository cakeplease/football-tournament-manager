**Project Assignment**

Your task is to create a tool for setup and result service for a multi-team tournament (chess, handball, badminton, volleyball, e-sports, quiz or similar). The primary user should be the tournament administrator. Each group is responsible to identify and make agreement with someone who can take the role and responsibility as user and product owner (customer).

The administrator should be able to choose format, enter teams and results. The system should have functions to show initial and intermediate setup of games and intermediate and final results. 
The requirements explained above are not final. Additional functions and features should be added according to feedback from the user tests.
