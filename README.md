Skoleprosjektet i Systemutvikling.

**Project Assignment**

Your task is to create a tool for setup and result service for a multi-team tournament (chess, handball, badminton,
volleyball, e-sports, quiz or similar). The primary user should be the tournament administrator. Each group is
responsible to identify and make agreement with someone who can take the role and responsibility as user and product
owner (customer).

The administrator should be able to choose format, enter teams and results. The system should have functions to show
initial and intermediate setup of games and intermediate and final results. The requirements explained above are not
final. Additional functions and features should be added according to feedback from the user tests.

Technical requirements

1. The application must be made as a standalone Java application (desktop application)
2. Keep persistent data in local files (as presented in Programming 2) or databases

Process The project should be carried out in three iterations. The result of the two first iterations are presented in
the first two team meetings, while the result of the third is presented in the project presentation. Iteration overview:

1. In the 1st iteration you should focus on the vision and requirements. Make an early prototype using BalsamiQ and
   perform a usability test using the prototype with users outside of the team. You should present this prototype at the
   first team meeting with the lecturer along with the vision document. You should also present the first version of the
   domain model, which is essential in explaining the problem.
2. In the 2nd iteration you should focus on making an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) using Java. MVP is a minimal viable
   product, meaning, it does not need to have more functionality than the bare minimum that is needed for the product to
   be usable. As such, what functionality that there is, should be relatively free of bugs, which is what in general
   differentiates an MVP from a prototype. This MVP should also be presented to the users and tested. You should present
   this MVP at the second team meeting with the lecturer along with the first version of the requirements documentation
   WIKI.
3. In the 3rd iteration you should focus on finishing the application and all the documentation and attachments.

Basic project elements Your team is employed by a computer consulting company that has been commissioned to develop the
new information system. Notice that the team must create its own full-fledged system. As a student, you will mainly play
the role of a systems consultant designing and implementing the system. Lecturer plays the role as a mentor in addition
to expert advisors. • As a systems consultant, you have an hourly salary rate of NOK 1599.-. • You must consider any
costs in terms of personnel and software. • Each team member has approx. 150 hours for her/his disposal +/ - 10 %. • In
the milestone plan, you will find deadlines for compulsory deliveries. • To ensure the quality of the application the
team must continuously undertake unit testing using JUnit. • To ensure high usability and a good user experience the
application must relate to Don Norman’s principles of interaction design • In order to evaluate the user experience the
team must carry out usability tests after the first and second iteration (wireframe and MVP)
• Universal Design – the application must be designed according to WCAG 2.1 principle 1 - Perceivable Resources You will
find the project resources, including document templates, in the project-folder on Blackboard. Usages of collaboration
tools The team must use collaboration tools as a part of the project. E.g. tools like
Gitlab (https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/users/sign_in), GitLab WIKI, GitLab Issueboard, Mattermost, Gitlab Pages,
Balsamiq, Google Drive etc. Experiences in using these tools must be summarized in the main report. Balsamiq license:
Available in Blackboard- You need to start with a 30 days free trial.
